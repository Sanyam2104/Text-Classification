# Text-Classification

This model uses fetch20newsgroup data in which there are around 20,000 documents which are classified in 20 different categories.

I've built my own Naive bayes model and also used sklearn inbuilt naive bayes model to classify text.

To use this repository, just download the .pynb file and run the cells, it'll take around 10 min to get train.
